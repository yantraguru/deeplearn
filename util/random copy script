#shuf shuffles the list of *.jpg files in the current directory.
#-z is to zero-terminate each line, so that files with special characters are treated correctly.
#-n8 exits shuf after 8 files.
#xargs -0 reads the input delimited by a null character (from shuf -z) and runs cp.
#-v is to print every copy verbosely.
#-t is to specify the target directory.
