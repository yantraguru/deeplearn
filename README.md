# deeplearn
### Various experiments in Artificial neural networks and deep learning

## 01. **Basics**
1. Can single neuron with no activation learn simple linear functions?
2. How to validate learning and When to stop the learning process?
3. How stacking multiple non-linear neurons can learn any complex function?
