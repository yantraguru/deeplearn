# deeplearn
### Various experiments in Artificial neural networks and deep learning

## 01. **Basics**
1. Can single neuron with no activation learn simple linear functions? [Notebook](./../1_neuron_guessing_linear_functions.ipynb)
2. How to validate learning and When to stop the learning process? [Notebook](./../1_neuron_network_validation_and_early_stopping.ipynb)
3. How stacking multiple non-linear neurons can learn any complex function? [Notebook](./../1_neuron_vs_layer_of_many_for_guessing_complex_functions.ipynb)
